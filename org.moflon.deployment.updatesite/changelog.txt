2018-02-08 eMoflon 3.0.0 released
User notes
This is the first modularized version of eMoflon.
Now, we provide a very basic eMoflon Core and the traditional eMoflon Tool.

eMoflon Core currently contains
* Support for creating "eMoflon EMF Projects", which provide auto-build for EMF projects.
  Method bodies can be provided via injections.
* Utilities such as Git Reset Repository, Touch Resource, Trigger Full Build, Trigger Incremental Build

eMolfon Tool currently contains
* All the rest :-)
* Story-Driven Modeling (compiler)
* Triple Graph Grammars (visual and textual; compiler)

2017-03-24 eMoflon 2.29.0 released

User notes:
* eMoflon now provides an efficient analysis for determining whether a search plan for a pattern may exist.
  This avoids that the build process for invalid patterns runs indefinitely.
* Most plugins should now ship with the source code, only plugins that are extracted during installation will not conveneniently provide the source code (e.g., org.moflon.ide.workspaceinstaller.psf).
* The Schema.tgg file of MOSL-TGG projects is now located in /src/[project-name].org.moflon.tgg.mosl/Schema.tgg
 * Old specifications remain compatible: The MOSL-TGG builder searches for any file named Schema.tgg in the /src folder.

Developer notes:
* Work on reachability analysis is on its way! We already support all patterns whose operations have no "NOT_TYPECKED" adornment
* The syntax of MOSL-GT now contains no more '#s'
* The signing script is now a Makefile -> parallelization support

Closed issues:
* MOSL-GT: Get rid of all these #'s #215
* Reachability: Consider local variables as well? #210
* Reachability analysis: Proper creation of transition relation? #207
* Rename csp.constraints package in org.moflon.tgg.language feature-request medium-priority #202
* Eliminate custom deployment procedure of eMoflon completely #201
* Source code still missing from deployed eMoflon #195
* Parallelize signing script #191
* Disable Ecore visualization until it is more stable #188
* The generated package for Schema.tgg should be renamed #185
* Integrate reachability analysis into build process #120
* Refactor MOSL-TGG TGG with refinements #57

2017-02-22 eMoflon 2.28.0 released

This release is a maintenance release with several internal refactorings.
No need for eMoflon users to update immediately.

2017-01-20 eMoflon 2.26.0 released

This release fixes problems with name clashes of generated packages and eMoflon-internal packages

User notes:
* After eMoflon 2.25.0 was the first eMoflon to be signed, we discovered that some of the generated packages in user projects clash with the signed packages, which yielded a SecurityException.
  This is fixed in the current release.
  * Solved: Ensure unique package prefix for packages in eMoflon developer workspace #181
  * Solved: Security exception due to signer information #180

---
2016-12-29 eMoflon 2.25.0 release

	This is a minor release. An update from 2.24.0 ist not necessary.

	User notes:
	* From 2.25.0 on, eMoflon requires Eclipse Neon. We discontinue support for all previous versions of Eclipse.
	* From 2.25.0 on, we disable all migration routines, which automatically transform eMoflon projects prior to eMoflon 2.17.0.
	  If you intend to update to eMoflon 2.25.0 or newer, please proceed as follows:
		+ First update to eMoflon 2.24.0 (https://github.com/eMoflon/emoflon-tool/releases/tag/emoflon_2.24.0)
		+ Re-build all your projects
		+ Check and save/commit/... all modifications performed by the automatic migration routines
		+ Update to the desired eMoflon (2.25.0 or newer).

		+ The order of tabs in the property view has changed.

	Developer notes:
	* Add facility for dumping control flow structure #161
		+ Accessible from the eMoflon context menu as "Validate (with CF dump)"

	Further fixed/solved issues:
	* Set default method body handler to DEMOCLES_ATTRIBUTES if a metamodel contains CSP constraints #156

---
2016-11-23 eMoflon 2.24.0 release

	User notes:

	Developer notes:
	* GraViTY has been added to the test suite (requires MoDisco, accessible via the menu Test Workspaces and as auto-test config 'TestWorkspace_Gravity')

	Fixed issues:
	* Remove Co-Evolution Feature from eMoflon Update Site #147
		* The feature has never gained stability, and with the planned MOSL-GT, the refactoring framework needs to be rebuilt, anyway.
	* Add Touch command to eMoflon menu #146
		* This entry in the eMoflon context menu allows you to selectively trigger an incremental build.
	* Folders for namespaces aren't created in injection exporter
	* Discouraged access in TGGFormatter #141
	* Simplify structure of handbook #128

2016-09-17 eMoflon 2.19.0 released
	Developer Notes:
	* Build data:
		* eMoflon 2.18.0 (https://emoflon.github.io/eclipse-plugin/emoflon_2.18.0/update-site2/)
		* Eclipse Neon (4.6.0)
		* Tag: https://github.com/eMoflon/emoflon-tool/releases/tag/emoflon_2.19.0
	* Performed a lot of cleanup
		- Mainly pure refactoring to avoid using deprecated methods.
		- Get rid of EMoflonPlugin (emoflon/emoflon#775)
		- ...
	* All PSF files now point to the new repositories - migration complete.
	* All **open** issues have been migrated to emoflon/emoflon-tool. All **closed** issues remain in emoflon/emoflon due to otherwise excessive administrative effort.
	* The old TGG.eap files (and corresponding renamed ones) could not be moved to GitHub because their size exceeded 100MB.
	  To avoid using GitHub LFS for these very outdated files, I completely removed them.
	* The hierarchical branch structure in the SVN repository could not be migrated, i.e., each of the imported branches represents a set of SVN branches - sorry.
	User Notes:
	* Migrate eMoflon to GitHub (https://github.com/eMoflon/emoflon-tool/)

2016-06-02	eMoflon 2.16.0 released
	User Notes:
	* Please mind that we have recently moved our website and Eclipse update site to GitHub (https://emoflon.github.io ).

	Fix critical bugs in MOSL-TGG that break the bootstrapping
	Implement merge algorithm for PSFs in WorkspaceInstaller #715
	Disable automatic suppression of warnings for projects #718
	Get rid of managed EAP files #708

---
2016-05-03	eMoflon 2.15.0 released
	User Notes:
	* For your information: From today on, we host our update sites on GitHub Pages ( https://emoflon.github.io/ ). We adjusted all links in the handbook and on www.emoflon.org .
	* During our hacker days last week, we have fixed a huge number of bugs and pushed MOSL-TGG - the new textual syntax for TGGs.
	* We had to downgrade to the 'more official' version of PlantUML for our visualization. In case of problems, please uninstall PlanUML and re-install from the following update site: http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/updatesitejuno/

	Developer Notes:
	* All tests are green, tags have been created for the current state of the handbook (/tags/Handbook/emoflon_2.15.0) and the developer workspace (/tags/emoflon_2.15.0).
	* We have modularized the eMoflon workspace. Please note that 'All Modules' does currently NOT contain MOSL TGG for performance reasons.
	* The XText SDK (>=2.9.1) is now a mandatory prerequisite of eMoflon.

	Downgraded PlantUML from 1.1.11 to 1.1.8 as the update site we were using ceased to work.  The current update site appears to be more stable and directly from the PlantUML developers.
	Our new textual concrete syntax for TGGs, MOSL-TGG, is now more or less usable.   Many issues are still open but one can work with it already.
	The handbook chapter on TGGs has had a major update and now uses MOSL-TGG.
	Our delta editor for model synchronisation has been improved and tested
	Introduce new modules to structure eMoflon developer workspace
	Discontinue Part 5 of handbook
	Documenation of new features in SDM CPSs
	More selective export during workspace installation #706

---
2016-04-05	eMoflon 2.13.0 released
	User Notes:
	* Performance improvements in the build process (now using Eclipse "WorkspaceJobs")
	* The syntax for complex attribute constraints has been updated to support importing "external" meta-models.
	* The textual syntax for TGGs is now available (documentation coming soon).

	Developer Notes:
	* The developer workspace has several new projects due to the integration of MOSL-TGG.
	When checking out the developer workspace, the automatic build procedure will fail because some XText-specific artefacts cannot currently be built automatically.
	For this reason: Run you need to run the Mwe2 workflow in project org.moflon.tgg.mosl manually ("Run as...") and re-build " org.moflon.tgg.mosl.specification" (only a rebuild is required, no re-export).
	We are working on this issue.

	Bugfix: Errors in validation are not reported properly #668
	Build process: A single failure should not stop the whole build process #670
	Introduce a timeout for the validation process
	Redundant rebuilds when manually building multiple projects #677
	New syntax for SDM-CSPs: "importPackage Ecore;", "::" notation for literals, support for EEnum types

---
2016-02-22	eMoflon 2.12.0 released
	User Notes:
	* This is a **bugfix** release that solves issues in EA ("OV sorting bug") and TGG ("parallel streams bug") and brings improvements in the GUI.
	Developer notes:
	* Nothing special.

	Fix "Sort order" bug in EA

---
2016-02-11	eMoflon 2.11.0 released
	User Notes:

	Developer notes:
	* A new project (org.moflon.sdm.compiler.democles.derivedfeatures) has been added to the work space.

	Add org.moflon.sdm.compiler.democles.derivedfeatures
	Beta version of Ecore-to-EAP importer ready

	* generated method names now contain the name of their original SDM story node (if the node consists only of blanks, letters, digits, '-'s, and '_'s)
	* An initial library with auxiliary data types for working with Ecore is now integrated in all new meta-models (https://github.com/eMoflon/emoflon/issues/653)
	Developer notes:
	* A new project has been added to the workspace (https://dev.kom.e-technik.tu-darmstadt.de/svn/es_emoflon/trunk/org.moflon.core.ecoreutils) Please update your PSF files or upgrade to eMoflon 2.10.0 to avoid problems during deployment.

    Support for Eclipse Mars
    eMoflon builds and runs on Eclipse Mars.
    Improved handling of injections:
        Problems in injection files are now shown as error markers and will not stop the build process
        eMoflon now has a save action that automatically extracs an injection from a Java file being saved.
        To enable this feature, select Window -> Preferences -> Java/Editor/SaveActions and enable "Create Injections" under Additional Actions.
    Solved depency conflict for Apache Log4j, Commons IO, and Commons Lang
    The previous treatment of these dependencies resulted in conflicts for users that require a different version than the exported one (Opens external link in new windowIssue #374). This issue is now fixed by shipping these libraries as separate bundles.
    Improved validation error messages

2015-02-05	eMoflon 1.7.0 released
    New versioning scheme for eMoflon: To simplify distinguishing different versions of eMoflon, we use the following versioning scheme in the future: Version numbers are of the form X.Y.Z. Numbers X and Y denote major and minor releases, while the final number Z denotes beta releases.
    Plugin-based dependency handling: Since this version, eMoflon uses the Eclipse plugin infrastructure for dependency handling.
    This also means that you can choose freely whether to use installed plugins or whether to override them with plugin projects in the workspace.
    Arbitrary project names: Project names may now be any valid package identifier, e.g., org.moflon.utility_functions.
    New tagged values (EA): The set of possible tagged values in Enterprise Architect has been extended. All tagged values now bear the prefix Moflon::.
    Integration of Democles pattern matcher: Improved loop detection; Introduce 'continue' statement in loops; improved validation messages
    Handbook: Visual syntax completely tested for release; textual syntax: best effort; update of all 'cheat  wizards'
